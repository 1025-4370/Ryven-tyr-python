<aside class="warning">
Please be aware that this whole project is a proof of concept and not ment for private development. It is meant to show the idea and the code is not focused on readability at all. However I think this has the potential to become something really intuitive and practical. But for now, it is far away from that. How that project is going to evolve will depend on the resonance of this project.
