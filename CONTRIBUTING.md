# Philosophy :cyclone:

Ryven is meant to be a **simple** and **transparent** tool for visual scripting in Python.
It does not intend to replace textual source code by the diagram representation, rather to enhance it.
Any form of optimization shall only be considered if it does not considerably restrict or significantly complicate the functionality of the software. The idea is to provide a simple but powerful system for nodes and node packages with virtually no restrictions, so even fairly advanced mechanisms can be built on top of it.

# Contributions In General :rocket:

There are many ways you can contribute to the Ryven project.
If you want to help out, there are a few particularly effective options including improvement regarding

- docstrings
- online documentation
- example content: nodes and projects

# Creating Good Issues :mega:

- you might check the [information on the website](https://ryven.org/guides) before you open a new issue
- always be precise and, if possible, include a minimal procedure to reproduce the problem
- you can also use the *discussions* area for suggestions around improvements and FAQ

Thanks for hanging around and have a nice day!
